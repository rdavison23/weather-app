# Weather App — React + Express + OpenWeatherMap

- A minimal full‑stack weather application built with React (Vite) on the frontend and ExpressJS on the backend.
- The app fetches real‑time weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
  API, displays key weather details, and dynamically updates the background based on day/night conditions.
